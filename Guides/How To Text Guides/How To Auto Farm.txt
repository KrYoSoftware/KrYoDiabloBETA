Ingame:
Open map
Click the search/legend button
Click the legend waypoint in search (1.2.3.4 or whatever) to center the map to this waypoint

In bot:
Click green mark
Go in-game map ,opened like above and then f3 click your farming points you want (you need to have map centered on nearest waypoint)
Than escape to save
Start running bot

In bot the buttons 1.2.3.4. stand for the waypoint locations in search tab in-game.
1 is the first
2 the second
3 the third
And so on

You can make a extreme farming route in one zone, cause you have much enough waypoints you can set with f3.

Bot will automatically randomize the mouse licks after you started, so it's not exactly the same and also not exactly your route.

Macros i run with the bot:
scan attack resume navi
TK revive
TK 50% HP backup
TK declineall
